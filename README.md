# TestMetrics
Test Metrics :


Various contributors. Software testing metrics are a way to measure and monitor your test activities. More importantly, they give insights into your team's test progress, productivity, and the quality of the system under test.


Total TC = 70, Not executed TC=1
Pass=62
Fail=5, Out of Scope= 2

1.       % of Test Cases Executed: No of test cases executed/Total no of test cases written *100

                Let,
                 No of the TC executed a= 62 ,
                  Total No of the TC b= 70
                  a/b×100 = (62/70)×100 =88.57%

2.      % of Test Cases Not Executed:( No of test cases Not executed/Total no of test cases written )*100
               
                No of the TC  Not executed a= 62 ,
                  Total No of the TC b= 70

3.       % of Test  cases passed : (No of test cases passed/  Total test cases executed)* 100
              
              
                Test cases passed = 62
                 a/b= (62/70)×100 = 88.57%
        


4.       % of Test  cases failed : (No of test cases failed/  Total test cases executed)* 100
                Test cases failed = 5

5.       % of Test cases blocked : ( No of test cases blocked/  Total test cases executed)* 100
                        No of Tc  blocked a= 7
                         Test case executed  b = 54
                         a/b×100= (7/70)×100=10%

6.      Defect Density : Number of defects identified by per requirments

                 No of defects found/ size(no of requirments)
                        Let No of defect found a= 2 
                        Size b =500
                        a/b ×100 = (2/500)×100=0.4
7.    

        Defect removal Efficiency :
        A/(A+B)*100
        Fixed Defects/(Fixed Defects+Missed Defects)*100

        A= Defect identified during testing/fixed defect,
         B = Defects identified
        by customer/Missed defects

        A=0.4,B=1.5,{0.4/(0.4+1.5)}×100= 21.053%

8. Defect Leakage:(No of defects found in UAT/No of defects found in testing
 ) *100
        UAT defects =2
        Defects found in testing=5
         a=2,b=5,a/b×100=2/5×100=40%


9.Defect Rejection Ratio : (No of defect rejected/Total no of defect raises)*100
        Defect rejected=5
        Defect raises 10
        a=5 b =10, a/b×100=( 5/10)×100=50%
10. Defect Age: Fixed Date - Reported Date

11. Customer setisfection: No of complaints per period of time
